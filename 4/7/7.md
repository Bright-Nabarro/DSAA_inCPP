$\sum_{i=1}^{m} 2^{-d_i} \leq 1$

In the special case where the tree consists
only of leaves and full nodes, the original
formula equals 1.

When a node is inserted into such trees
the number of the leaves remain constant
but only one leaves depth increases.
As a result, the sum of $2^{-d_i}$ decrease,
 upholding the inequality.

Conversely, if a node is removed from these trees,
the number of leaves decreases, and the depths of the
remaining leaves stay the same.
So this also ensures that the sum of $2^{-d_i}$ for all
remaing leaves does not exceed 1, upholing the inequality.
