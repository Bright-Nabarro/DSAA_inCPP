- Queue or stack stores the vectices whose indegree decrease down to zero.
- Using a queue means adopting the FIFO stargety, so that the vectices which are founded earlier
can be processed earlier. In this way, vectices are processed in breadth-first search order.
- Since using a stack means adopting the LIFO stargety, and vectices are processed in depth-first search.
