# 3.18

- First, we add a `const_iterator` pointer list in `ListNode`
to track all iterators points to it. And we include a destructor.
When the node is deleted, we set all iterators in the list
to nullptr.

- Next, we modify `const_iterator`'s constructor so that it adds
itself to the list in `ListNode`. Similary, we implement a
destructor. When an iterator needs to be deleted, it is removed
from `const_iteraot` list.

- Finally, let's consider the `erase` method. Notice that all
removal methods we provide are implemented by invoking erase in
different parameters. When a node is deleted in `erase` method,
its destructor automactically takes care of the elimination work,
involving the sets **stale** work above. So there is no nedd for
any additional cleanup.
