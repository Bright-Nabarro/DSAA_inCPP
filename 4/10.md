## a

none full node

$f(1) = f(0) = 0$

## b

$$
f(N) = \frac{N-2}{N} + \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{(f(i) - i - 1)}
\quad \quad(N>1)
$$

$\frac{N-2}{N}$ is the average number that root is full note
despite two extreme cases that root is the biggest or the smallest

Apart from root node we assum i left nodes and N - i - 1 right nodes,
so the answer is:
$$
f(N) = \frac{N-2}{N} + f(i) + f(N-i-1)
$$

But we don't know what i is, so we sum of all cases,
from i = 0 through N-1, and then divide them by N to
gain the average number of left subtree and right subtree.

So f(N) is the Sum of the average number of root, left subtree
and right subtree

## c

$$
f(2)
=
0 + \frac{1}{2} +
\sum_{i=0}^{1}(f(i)+f(2-i-1))\\
= 0
$$
